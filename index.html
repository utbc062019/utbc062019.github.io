                Hi I am Dawen Sui, call me D, or the greatest guy in the universe or multiverse.
                &#128527; &#128540; <i class="em em-ghost"></i>  I hold a master degree in engineering 
                not to brag and have worked my butt off for the first half of my life as a professional
                engineer but finally got bored of it.<br>I always thought coding was cool but never 
                got a chance to learn it and do it with my own hand. Now I am kind of semi-retired 
                from my engineering career, although not as sharp as when I was younger, finally I 
                got a chance to try it. It's really fun.
                </P>
